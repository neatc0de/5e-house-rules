### Chapter 10: Spellcasting
* Spell Slots: (page 201)
  - Spell points are used instead of spell slots
  - Spell point pool calculation:
    - At first level, your spell pool is your spellcasting ability, plus its modifier
      - Example: A Sorcerer with CHA 14 has a pool of 14+2 = 16 spell points
    - For each additional level, add your spellcasting ability’s modifier
      - Example: At 2nd level, the above Sorcerer would add 2 more points to their pool
  - The above calculation is for all spellcasters except:
    - Paladins, Rangers, Eldritch Knights and Arcane Tricksters
      - For each level of Paladin or Ranger, take the above calculation and divide by 2 (round up)
      - For each level of Eldritch Knight or Arcane Trickster, take the above calculation and divide by 3 (round up)
  - To cast a spell, subtract the level of the spell your casting from your spell pool. This still enables casting spells at higher levels.
    - For example, if you cast Magic Missile as a 3rd level spell, instead of its native 1st level, you subtract 3 points from your spell pool

* Concentration: (page 203)
  - The DM will rule, on a school by school or spell by spell basis, which spells ignore any concentration property it has.
    - Illusion spells: any Illusion spells that have the Concentration property use it
    - Barkskin: ignores Concentration
    - Bane: ignores Concentration
    - Bless: ignores Concentration
    - Crusader’s Mantle: uses Concentration
    - Magic Weapon: ignores Concentration
    - (more to be added when ruled upon)
* Attack Rolls: (page 205)
  - Ranged spells are not cast at a disadvantage because you are within 5 feet of a target
